        "A retail chain with 120 stores struggled to keep shelves stocked on time due to slow internal communication and manual reorder tracking. Their commercial team relied on spreadsheets and had no system for proactively flagging low inventory.",
        "We deployed AI agents to monitor key SKUs, predict restocking needs, and notify responsible teams automatically. As a result, they reduced out-of-stock incidents by 38% and recovered over $120K in missed sales within 3 months.",
