        "An international distributor of premium spirits with over 30 product lines faced growing challenges managing inventory across countries. Operating in multiple time zones led to misaligned stock data, delayed reorders, and frequent stockouts â€” especially in high-demand regions.",
        "VeyaLab deployed AI agents to monitor stock levels in real time, align local availability with central sales plans, and automate restock processes across markets.",
        "As a result, stockouts in key markets dropped by 35%, which led to a 22% increase in sales across high-demand regions.",

      description: [
        "A retail chain with more than 120 stores struggled to keep shelves stocked on time due to weak internal communication and manual reorder tracking. Their commercial team relied on spreadsheets and had no system for proactively flagging low inventory.",
        "We deployed AI agents to monitor key SKUs, predict restocking needs, and notify responsible teams automatically.",
        "As a result, they reduced out-of-stock incidents by 38% and recovered over $120K in missed sales within 3 months.",

      description: [
        "A regional distributor had trouble enforcing restock commitments from partner stores. Follow-ups were manual, often delayed, and led to stockouts in high-margin categories.",
        "We implemented AI-driven reorder enforcement: agents sent friendly notifications, escalation emails, and finally compliance reports.",
        "The process increased timely reorders by 45% and helped protect an estimated $250K in quarterly revenue.",
